## Maintainer Guidelines

The Carpentries Maintainers work with the community to make sure that lessons stay up-to-date, accurate, functional and cohesive. They monitor
their lesson repository, make sure that PRs and Issues are addressed in a timely manner, and participate in the lesson development cycle
including lesson releases. They endeavour to be welcoming and supportive of contributions from all members of the community.

The division of responsibilities between Maintainers and Curriculum Advisors is detailed 
in [this consultation rubric](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/cac-consult-rubric.html).

Maintainers are responsible for:
 - Routinely:
    - Ensuring reasonable response time to all submitted Issues and PRs. At a minimum, ensuring all Issues and PRs are acknowledged within two days.
    - Quickly addressing issues and PRs tagged as “bug”s.
    - Submitting Issues as they arise.
    - Adhering to the Code of Conduct and alerting the Code of Conduct Committee to any potential violations.
    - Identifying potential new Maintainers based on their review activity.

- Periodically:
    - Helping prepare lessons for publication.
    - Bringing in updates to the lesson template.

Maintainers represent The Carpentries community and should strive to embody The Carpentries philosophy, by:
- Recognising the importance of communication and being welcoming to all contributors.
- Giving feedback to contributors using The Carpentries model:
    - Find what’s good. Be specific about improvements needed. Use motivational language.
- Evaluating lesson contributions in light of Carpentries pedagogical model:
    - Teach what’s most relevant and useful for learners.
    - Avoid getting bogged down in technical details.
    - Keep language motivating.
    - Emphasise the importance of continued learning and improvement.

## How to Stay in Touch

The overall Maintainer community communicates using our [mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/maintainers) and our [Slack channel](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/messages/C8H5LN44V/details/). If you do not already have a Slack account with The Carpentries, you can [create one](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).

The Maintainer community meets monthly to discuss issues relevant to all lesson Maintainers. Our meeting schedule can be found on [our CodiMD](https://codimd.carpentries.org/maintainers?both) and on the [community calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events).

Each Lesson Team also has their own Slack channel. A link to join your lesson's Slack channel can be found
in the README file in your lesson repository.

## How to Handle Issues

[The Maintainer Onboarding curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/) contains some guidelines for how to respond to community-submitted issues.

### Spam and Bots

The Maintainer Onboarding curriculum also contains 
[guidance on how to handle contributions you judge to be spam and/or made by automated/semi-automated GitHub accounts](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/02-communicate-contributors.html#bots-and-spam).

## How to Get Help

There are many ways to request help on an issue or PR you are reviewing. To get help from other Maintainers or the general community, use the `help wanted` or `good first issue` labels. If your lesson is included on [the Help Wanted page of The Carpentries website](https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/#for-maintainers), issues labelled `help wanted` will automatically be listed for potential contributors to find there.

If an issue affects the overall structure or scope of the lesson, you can refer the issue to your curriculum's [Curriculum Advisory Subcommittee](../lesson_development/lesson_development_roles.html#curriculum-advisory-committee) by assigning it to the appropriate CAC GitHub team. Curriculum Advisors meet approximately quarterly.

You can also get help from other Maintainers and interested community members by posting a question to your lesson's Slack channel.

## Maintainer Onboarding

**The process for Maintainer Onboarding is currently on hold.  If you are interested in becoming a lesson Maintainer, please contact us at [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org).**

New Maintainers go through an onboarding process, led by a member of The Carpentries Curriculum Team and the Maintainer Community Lead. Unless otherwise
specified in the workflow below, the duties below are divided ad hoc between
Curriculum Team member and Maintainer Community Lead. 

The curriculum for
onboarding new Maintainers is available as a
[Maintainer Onboarding Lesson](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/).
This documentation describes how to recruit new Maintainers and take them through
the onboarding process. 

*Note to Core Team members:* the workflow below is also available as a 
[Asana project template](https://app.asana.com/0/1185099340351503/list). Once you've created your project, share it with the Maintainer Community Lead.  

1. Identify lessons in need of additional maintenance support. This includes surveying current Maintainers using [a Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSQJt-jQ9HETI8RGqxt7_XPhqNC8LTMsq3elkaLBnVg88OKA/viewform). 
1. Create a copy of the [Maintainer Onboarding recruitment form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXX8HWWltmDqw2T8GO4T7VV2OYG7PnVVEYHbEpS0MHA92Pyg/viewform) and adjust templated text as needed.  
1. Create a blog post to announce opening of applications. (Example [blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/06/maintainer_onboarding/).) Submit blog post text to the Communications Manager.

1. Populate the [Maintainer Onboarding Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/maintainer-onboarding) with meeting dates and times. Use [timeanddate meeting time announcer](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedform.html) links to make it easy for people to convert meeting times to their own time zone.
1. Create calendar invites with Zoom room and Etherpad link and send to trainees.
1. Set up a [new event in AMY](https://carpentries.github.io/amy/users_guide/#adding-a-new-event) with the slug YEAR-MO-DA-maintainer-onboarding. Add trainees as learners. Add onboarding leader (Curriculum Team member and/or Maintainer Community Lead) as instructor.
1. Decide on lesson assignments and send [lesson assignment email](email_templates.html#lesson-assignment).
1. One week before the first onboarding meeting, send a reminder [email](email_templates.html#onboarding-reminder).
1. Run onboarding according to [the curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/). Keep record of who participates.

After onboarding:
1. Send [congratulations email](email_templates.html#onboarding-complete) to new Maintainers.

Add new Maintainer to the appropriate team for [Software Carpentry][SWC GH Lesson Maintainer Teams], [Data Carpentry][DC GH Lesson Maintainer Teams], [Library Carpentry][LC GH Lesson Maintainer Teams], or [The Carpentries][The Carpentries GH Lesson Maintainer Teams] Lesson Maintainers. This will give them write privileges for that lesson's repo.
1. Add to lessons table on appropriate Lesson Program lesson page (e.g. <https://datacarpentry.org/lessons>). 
1. [Award them a Maintainer badge in AMY](https://carpentries.github.io/amy/users_guide/#issuing-badges). If the individual has [consented to having their profile published](https://carpentries.github.io/amy/users_guide/#adding-a-new-person), they will appear on [The Carpentries Maintainers page](https://carpentries.org/maintainers/) within a day.
1. Add them to the "maintainers" channel in the Carpentries Slack.
1. Add them to the ["maintainers" Topicbox email list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/maintainers).

## Maintainer Community Meetings

The Maintainer community meets on the third Wednesday of every month. Times for these meetings can be found on the [Community Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events). A reminder for these meetings should be sent out to the Maintainers email list one week before the meeting takes place, and the [Maintainers Etherpad](https://codimd.carpentries.org/maintainers?both) should also be updated. Ideally, these meetings will be co-facilitated by a member of [The Carpentries Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) and the Maintainer Community Development Lead.

The following is a Etherpad template that can be used as a Maintainer meeting agenda:
