## Contributing to Carpentries Lessons

Lesson Maintainers actively maintain all Carpentries lessons.
However, contributions are always welcome by all community members.
Novice contributors can read the [Instructions for contributing to The Carpentries' lesson materials
using graphical or command line interfaces with git and GitHub][novice-guide] developed by Carpentries Instructors.

The [Help Wanted page][hwp] lists issues in need of attention
and is a good place to find out where your contributions are most needed.
